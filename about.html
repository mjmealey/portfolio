<h1>About Me</h1>

<p class="aboutMe" id="container">
    Jake Mealey is an individual with a great work ethic and is dedicated to their craft in programming.
    Jake Mealey began pursuing programmming at the beginning of January 2023 in hopes of a career change. They have been participating in The Odin Project curriculum and have completed multiple projects including a recipe list, landing page, rock paper scissors game, etch-a-sketch, and a calculator app.
    Through these projects, Jake has learned how to properly structure and stylize websites as well as how to utilize javascript through functions, arrays, loops, the DOM and variables.
    Jake previously pursued photography after graduating from high school through community college and later university, but due to not being able to drive, salary, and unpredictable scheduling he decided to drop out to pursue programming for a more consistent and overall happy lifestyle.
    He loved photography for the creative freedom and the excitement he got from creating art through his knowledge of the work and this translates directly to programming and then some. Jake realized early in his programming journey that unlike photography where he was limited by uncontrollable circumstances, in programming, his only limit in creativity is a lack of knowledge to accomplish specific tasks. His dedication and perseverence as well as his desire to learn, however, allows him to overcome that limit daily and that is why he loves to program. Programming in itself can be considered an art form and the limit of learning is limitless.
