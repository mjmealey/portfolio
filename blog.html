        <p class="secondBlog" id="secondBlogOne">
          This past week has been amazing for my programming. I learned html
          tables alongside html forms and advanced css. The hardest part for me
          in the past week has definitely been regular expressions. The moment I
          came across my first pattern that being an email address pattern I was
          in shock considering its length. However, I hit a milestone in regular
          expressions today! I managed to memorize the pattern for the email
          address and the pattern for US phone numbers as well! I can also do
          the username and password patterns. Patterns are easily the most
          overwhelming part of forms given the length of some of them, but
          knowing these is a great step in the right direction for me and
          another struggle of mine in forms at first was javascript form
          validation, but I grew to learn that for the most part atleast what I
          have learned so far it is actually pretty simple to complete. Today, I
          started a project where I am making a sign up form and I am having a
          blast with it as I am making an lgbtq focused sign up form for the
          project and so far everything is going great, but I hit a roadblock at
          one point as I realized I forgot how to make the dropdown lists, but I
          went back to my learning resource and got a refresher on how it works.
          I decided to summarize what I did in an effort to show I know what is
          going on and for future reference. I plan on finishing the project
          sometime this week, but I don't know when as I want to go all out to
          make it as nice as possible. I hope it can be a portfolio piece.
        </p>
        <p class="secondBlog" id="secondBlogTwo">
          I've learned something in the past several weeks that I have been
          programming. Anytime you start a project, seek to make it the best it
          can possibly be based on your knowledge in web development. That
          project could be your gateway to your first job or your first contact
          or even a bigger love for web development as a whole. I have a lot of
          ideas for this sign up form project and I know I can make it work
          because I am determined to make it work and if I have to get
          assistance at times then I will do it to assure I learn everything I
          possibly can. Projects as a whole are learning experiences and can by
          extension be a life lesson. I am learning through this sign up form
          project that programming is indeed a collaborative field and often
          times is a team effort even if you don't have others doing a project
          with you. It is always a team effort because we as a workforce
          struggle on a daily basis because none of us know everything. We need
          assistance. We sometimes need motivation to keep pushing forward. You
          know what all of these things have in common? All of this is
          completely okay. I have been struggling to seek help when I need it
          because I end up feeling bad about myself knowing I didn't push on harder to do it on my own. However, programming as a whole is a team effort and we are not knowledge banks. We will struggle often and we will think less of ourselves every once in awhile, but in the end we will love our career more knowing we did push through and we did succeed because that births confidence and by extension a higher self esteem in general. We got this. We can do this. We will succeed in every aspect of our life and then some. We are an amazing breed of workers and nothing is going to take that away from us. Until next time my fellow programmers!

        <h2 id="firstBlogTitle">Hello, My First Blog Post 3/13/23</h2>
        <p class="firstBlog" id="firstBlogOne">
          Hello everyone, this is my very first blog post. This blog's goal is to
          document my journey as a programmer. The highs and the lows. I guess
          this first post could be my story on how I got onto this career path. In
          my last year of high school, 2019, I decided I wanted to pursue
          photography after seeing photos photos of stars online and thinking of
          how beautiful the milky way pictures were. I got accepted into the
          photography course at my local community college and after high school I
          began attending community college in the fall and I loved the photograhy
          program.
        </p>
        <p class="firstBlog" id="firstBlogTwo">
          I loved the art aspect of photography and seeing my experience reflect
          on my pictures. I grew to love art as a whole knowing that my only limit
          is my knowledge or so I thought. I don't drive currently as I have adhd
          and aspergers and I eventually began to realize that was heavily
          limiting my potential as a photographer and unfortunately it got worse.
          My favorite field of photography became photojournalism and I decided to
          attend Western Kentucky University's photojournalism program and while I
          loved it I began to realize even more how much of an overwhelming and
          wrong choice this was for me. Did I love what I was doing? Yes very much
          so. However, I struggled realizing just how expensive everything was
          especially in comparison to the expected salary of a photojournalist
          alongside the elephant in the room, without a driver's license it is
          next to impossible to take full advantage of photojournalism
          opportunities and while I did finish the first semester with a 4.0 I
          just felt too overwhelmed to continue due to the expenses, the lack of a
          driver's license and due to my autism the unpredictable schedule would
          ruin me mentally and at that point I decided I had to find another
          career path.       <img class="image" id="struggle" src="struggle.jpg">

        <p class="firstBlog" id="firstBlogThree">
          I did some research and found one of the best jobs in my situation would
          be to become a programmer. I can work from home, the salary is great,
          the schedule is relatively if not completely consistent and I love
          working with computers. I checked out multiple bootcamps and the reason
          I didn't sign up for any was the prices and soon after I discovered the
          Odin Project. I came to realize that the Odin Project was the perfect program
          for me to take due to the ability to work at my own pace and how
          thorough the program is with its teachings.
        </p>
        <p class="firstBlog" id="firstBlogFour">
          In the present day, it has been 2 months since I started my journey with
          the Odin Project and today I am embarking on the next part of my
          journey. During my time with the foundations program I made a recipes
          list with html and css, a landing page with html and css, a rock paper
          scissors game with html, css and javascript, an etch-a-sketch with html,
          css, and javascript and a calculator app using html, css, and javascript
          This past weekend I finalized my projects for the odin project's
          foundations course and while I plan to return to them to make them
          better pieces for my portfolio as I gain more experience, for now I am
          moving on to the full stack javascript program. I struggled a lot
          through the foundations course, in particular flex box and the
          javascript section, but I did it with a lot of help and through that
          help I was able to retain the information I was taught.
        </p>
        <p class="firstBlog" id="firstBlogFive">
          Throughout my experience in the foundation program I experienced a lot
          of mixed emotions. A lot of happy, a lot of questioning myself and a lot
          of sadness. At times I thought what I was doing wasn't worth it and I
          felt very dumb knowing I am struggling even on the basics, but I
          persisted and kept pushing through. I still struggle with this, but I
          often times refuse to seek assistance on a problem I have been trying to
          solve for 1-2 hours because I struggle to not feel bad about myself when
          I have to get help on something and I instead keep struggling and while
          it has helped mold my mindset into someone that is a problem solver
          albeit a beginner one, it is not healthy to refuse help especially when
          you have been struggling for an hour or longer. The hardest project for
          this particular experience was the calculator app. I kept questing my
          career choice thinking I messed up in dropping out and that I can't do
          this and that I am truly failing in life with my choice in career path.
          I questioned my ability to program knowing I had to get a lot of help on
          my calculator app and sure I got a lot of help on the etch-a-sketch as
          well, but I was able to retain all of that information through
          repetition, but the calculator app was a whole other beast for me. I
          struggle a lot with arrays and placement of code which is what the
          calculator app taught me, but the most important thing the calculator
          app taught me was this. It is okay to struggle. It is okay to be
          stressed out on something when you are new. We all have to start
          somewhere and everyone learns differently. Never give up on your dreams.
          Even when you get knocked down on your butt and struggle to get back up
          never ever give up if what you are doing is truly what you want to do. I
          fell in love with programming the moment I began css. Sure html was
          great, but css was when my world exploded in possibilities. As mentioned
          earlier, I love art and I realized sometihng in programming. Unlike
          photography where I was often limited by my inability to drive, I can do
          programming from anywhere. My only limit in programming is my knowledge
          of the craft. That's why I kept pushing even when I was at my wits end
          with the calculator app. I realized my dreams are in becoming a
          programmer now. I am in the mindset of an aspiring junior developer now,
          not an aspiring photographer. We solve problems and we get assistance
          when those problems have us backed up against a metaphorical wall. The
          next part of my journey is the Odin Project's full stack Javascript
          program and while I may not feel fully prepared to embark on the full
          stack program I know I can do it. I will work as hard as possible to
          accomplish my eventual goal, that being becoming a front-end developer.

          I hope my blog can help to motivate others to push forward in
          programming even when they are losing hope and maybe this will even help
          others outside of the programming field. I hope my blog can be that
          powerful and I hope this blog can make a difference. Keep pushing
          through. Never give up. Until next time. <img id="succeed" src="succeed.jpg"
