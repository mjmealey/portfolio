        This is a rock paper scissors project, but with a viking twist. I
        struggled to complete this for a long time as it was my very first
        programming project. I actually stopped working on it for awhile and
        returned to it after my second javascript project. However, looking back
        at it now, this is some of the most fun I have had completing a project
        in my life.
      </p>
      <p id="rpsDescTwo">
        The game is simple, but effective as it is just a match between the user
        and computer to see who reaches 5 points first with the given moves.
      </p>
      <p id="rpsDescThree">
        Despite the simplicity though, the simplicity itself is vital to what
        this project was about for me. A reminder that javascript can still
        invite creative freedom and that is why I fell in love with this
        language and css. Altogether, this project helped me to unleash the
        creative freedom that I missed when I moved on from css in my curriculum
        and showed me that despite javascript being about logic there is still
        plenty of creativity in store.

      <p id="etchasketchDescOne">
        This is an etch a sketch project and is the most DOM heavy project I
        have completed so far. I had a blast and I did have a lot of help, but I
        was able to learn and retain everything I did throughout the project.
      </p>
      <p id="etchasketchDescTwo">
        The Etch-a-Sketch comprises of 20 different grids based on the color of
        the user's choosing and resets accordingly. The grids are choices of
        size:16x16 and 64x64.
      </p>
      <p id="etchasketchDescThree">
        Overall, this project was a fantastic way for me to learn extensively
        about the DOM and I am more than happy to show this as a portfolio piece
        knowing it gave me the confidence to handle the dom on my own and while
        I struggled immensely on the rock paper scissors project, this project
        gave me the confidence to return to that project and finish it.

      <p id="calculatorDescOne">
        This is the most difficult project I've tackled so far in my curriculum.
        I struggled a lot and at times contemplated quitting my programming
        journey, and I had a lot of help. However, I realized thanks to this
        project that struggling is okay and if anything I should be truly proud
        of myself for getting this far.
      </p>

      <p id="calculatorDescTwo">
        The calculator is able to do exponents, multiplication, division,
        addition, and subtraction and has keyboard support, a backspace button,
        decimal support and a clear button.
      </p>
      <p id="calculatorDescThree">
        I loved this project as it showed me how important placement of code is,
        how arrays can drastically change the landscape of a project, and how
        both the front end and back end can work together to build something
        amazing.
